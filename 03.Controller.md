# Controller

Lest create a User Form which can handle user registration

## Form

Add a form for the home page
```html
    <div>
        <h3>Register</h3>
        <form action="/register" method="POST">
            @csrf
            <input type="text" placeholder="name">
            <input type="text" placeholder="email">
            <input type="password" placeholder="password">
            <button>Register</button>
        </form>
    </div>
```
The **@csrf** basically takes care of CyberSecurity issues

## Controller
Now we could add this to our Routes file but instead we will add it to the Controller\
Inside */app/Http/Controllers* you will find a **controller.php** file\
This basically allows us to add more functions for pages but without cluttering *web.php* file\
But we will can create a new Controller with the following command
```bash
    php artisan make:controller UserController
```

Then inside the class we add the following code
```php
    public function register(){
        return "Sucess - from Controller";
    }
```

Then inside the *web.php* file we will add the following function
```php
    Route::post("/register", [UserController::class, 'register']);
```
UserController represents the class we are using while the second one is for the function\
When we modify add the Controller and then reference it in the Routes we will be able to call it from there
