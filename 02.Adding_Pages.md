# Adding Pages

## Views

The **views** folder can be found in */resources/views*\
There you will see *welcome.blade.php* file which is displayed at start\
Here we can create a new file like **home.blade.php**\
\
Now write a basic HTML layout for your Homepage

## Routes

Because this new **View** needs to be **Routed** we need to modify the **web.php** in */routes/*\
If we open this we will see the following method:
```php
    Route::get('/', function () {
        return view('welcome');
    });
```
If we change *welcome* to *home* and reload it it will display our new page\

## Form

Add a form for the home page
```html
    <div>
        <h3>Register</h3>
        <form action="/register" method="POST">
            @csrf
            <input type="text" placeholder="username">
            <input type="text" placeholder="email">
            <input type="password" placeholder="password">
            <button>Register</button>
        </form>
    </div>
```
The **@csrf** basically takes care of CyberSecurity issues

Then inside **web.php** you can add the following code to handle the register
```php
    Route::post("/register", function(){
        return "Sucess";
    });
```
