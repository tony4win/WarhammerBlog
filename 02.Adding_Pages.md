# Adding Pages

## Views

The **views** folder can be found in */resources/views*\
There you will see *welcome.blade.php* file which is displayed at start\
Here we can create a new file like **home.blade.php**\
\
Now write a basic HTML layout for your Homepage

## Routes

Because this new **View** needs to be **Routed** we need to modify the **web.php** in */routes/*\
If we open this we will see the following method:
```php
    Route::get('/', function () {
        return view('welcome');
    });
```
If we change *welcome* to *home* and reload it it will display our new page
