## Database Migration

This refers to Migrating all the Laravel Data into your selected database\
First we need to create a database in SQL\
Then we need to modify the **.env** file with the propper credentials
```conf
    DB_DATABASE=warhammer_database
``` 
Then to actially migrate we need to run\
If it doesnt run make sure you are using the propper db (mariadb)
```bash
    php artisan migrate
```
This command will add all the Tables that Laravel needs

## Passing Data

To cnrypt the password being passed we use 
```php
    $input_fields['password'] = bcrypt($input_fields['password']);
```
Then to pass the data to the Database we need to import
```php
    use App\Models\User;
```
Then to use it we do
```php
    User::create($input_fields);
```
Now if you pass the data to the input fields you can see the data is passed\
This is also called a Model (Laravel has it automatically), check *App\Models\User*\
So even if we havent declared it as you can see in the Database we have username, password, etc
