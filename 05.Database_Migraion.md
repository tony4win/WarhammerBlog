# Database Migration

This refers to Migrating all the Laravel Data into your selected database\
First we need to create a database in SQL\
Then we need to modify the **.env** file with the propper credentials
```conf
    DB_DATABASE=warhammer_database
``` 
Then to actially migrate we need to run\
If it doesnt run make sure you are using the propper db (mariadb)
```bash
    php artisan migrate
