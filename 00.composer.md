# Composer

## Intro

**Composer** is a tool used for dependancies\
In laravel this is done automatically\
Composer is responsible for **composer.json** & **composer.lock** files

## Installing Manually
You can install dependancies manually with this command (ex slugify) :
```bash
    composer require cocur/slugify
```
This is done automatically but you will see when you run it on a folder\
where the command was not run, it will generate the two files & the **/vendor/** folder\
Inside this folder you will also find **autoload.php** file

## Including in PHP

To load this in a php file we would need the following code\
Note that in Laravel we would not need to do this!!!
```php
    require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';
    use Cocur/Slugify/Slugify;
```
